## Description
"Discountinator" is a website designed to help users track prices of various items by providing only the link.
## Usage
By opening the website the user is greeted with a login page:

![login](https://github.com/Serious-Fin/discountinator/assets/70478387/2e87b1cd-28dd-4cb2-99ef-391fcefb3fc4)

First time users have to *register* for an account. After successful registration an email confirmation is required.
After all is set up the user can finally add their items to the website. The main page looks like this:
